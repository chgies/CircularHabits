# Swipe Implementation for MyHabits Screen

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of swipe gestures and list view functionality for the MyHabits screen.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Horizontal Swipe Gestures
- **Swipe Right (Complete Habit)**
  - Threshold: 1/3 of screen width
  - Background: Green with increasing opacity
  - Icon: Checkmark (Icons.check)
  - Action: Marks habit as complete and navigates to next habit
  
- **Swipe Left (Edit Habit)**
  - Threshold: 1/3 of screen width
  - Background: Yellow with increasing opacity
  - Icon: Gear/Settings (Icons.settings)
  - Action: Opens edit screen for the habit

### 2. Vertical Swipe Navigation (Circular)
- **Swipe Up**: Navigate to next habit
- **Swipe Down**: Navigate to previous habit
- **Circular Navigation**: When at the last habit and scrolling down, jumps to first habit
- **Reverse Circular**: When at the first habit and scrolling up, jumps to last habit

### 3. Habits List Dialog
- Accessible via list icon (Icons.list) in AppBar
- Shows all habits with their completion status
- Green checkmark for completed habits
- Empty checkbox for incomplete habits
- Clicking checkbox toggles completion status
- Changes are immediately visible due to optimistic updates

## Technical Details

### Component Structure

#### MyHabitsScreen
- Added list icon button to AppBar (first action button)
- Shows HabitsListDialog when clicked
- Uses BlocProvider.value to share HabitBloc with dialog

#### HabitPageView
- Changed PageView scroll direction to vertical
- Added NotificationListener for scroll boundaries
- Implements circular navigation using jumpToPage at boundaries
- Navigation is delayed slightly to allow scroll animation to complete

#### SwipeableHabitCard
- Custom widget handling horizontal swipe gestures
- Uses GestureDetector for drag events
- Implements visual feedback during drag:
  - Stack with background color/icon
  - Transform.translate for card movement
  - Progress-based opacity for smooth animation
  - Icon size scales with progress
  
#### HabitsListDialog
- Material Dialog showing all habits
- ListView with checkboxes for each habit
- Uses BlocProvider.value to share HabitBloc
- Immediate UI updates through optimistic state management
- Green text and bold font for completed habits

### Key Implementation Details

1. **Threshold Calculation**
   ```dart
   final threshold = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width / 3;
   ```

2. **Progress Calculation**
   ```dart
   final progress = (_dragExtent.abs() / threshold).clamp(0.0, 1.0);
   ```

3. **Circular Navigation**
   ```dart
   // At last page scrolling down -> jump to first
   if (_currentPage == habits.length - 1 && 
       metrics.pixels >= metrics.maxScrollExtent) {
     _pageController.jumpToPage(0);
   }
   // At first page scrolling up -> jump to last
   else if (_currentPage == 0 && 
            metrics.pixels <= metrics.minScrollExtent) {
     _pageController.jumpToPage(habits.length - 1);
   }
   ```

4. **Optimistic Updates**
   - All habit changes use existing HabitBloc events
   - State updates are immediate (already implemented in HabitBloc)
   - No additional state management needed

## User Experience

### Visual Feedback
1. **During Swipe**
   - Progressive color fade-in (green/yellow)
   - Icon appears and scales with progress
   - Card translates with finger movement

2. **On Complete**
   - Swipe right triggers completion and auto-navigation
   - Swipe left opens edit screen
   - All changes reflect immediately in UI

3. **List View**
   - Clear visual distinction for completed habits
   - Green text and checkmark for completed
   - Gray checkbox for incomplete
   - Instant toggle on tap
   - Dialog closes with X button or back navigation

4. **Circular Navigation**
   - Seamless transition from last to first habit
   - Smooth scroll experience maintained

## User Instructions
The habit card displays helper text:
> "Swipe right to complete • Swipe left to edit • Swipe up/down to navigate"

## Compatibility
- Uses existing BLoC pattern
- Leverages optimistic UI updates already in HabitBloc
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Maintains all previous features (photo picker, delete button, etc.)
- Button-based completion still works alongside swipe gestures

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Test horizontal swipes (left/right)
   - Verify threshold (1/3 screen)
   - Check visual feedback (colors, icons)
   - Confirm actions (complete, edit)
   - Test partial swipes (less than threshold)
   
2. Test vertical swipes (up/down)
   - Verify circular navigation
   - Check smooth transitions
   - Test boundary conditions (first/last habit)
   
3. Test list dialog
   - Open list from AppBar icon
   - Toggle completion status
   - Verify immediate updates
   - Check visual styling for completed habits
   
4. Test with single habit (edge case)
   - Should handle circular navigation gracefully
   - Circular scroll behavior should work
   
5. Test with completed habits
   - Verify green color in list
   - Confirm toggle works both ways
   - Check that swiping right on completed habit uncompletes it
   
6. Test interaction conflicts
   - Horizontal swipe shouldn't interfere with vertical scroll
   - Vertical scroll shouldn't interfere with horizontal swipe
   - Photo picker interaction should still work

### Integration Testing
Key test scenarios would include:
- Swipe gestures with various drag distances
- Circular navigation boundary conditions
- List dialog state synchronization
- Optimistic update behavior
- Multiple rapid swipes
- State preservation after navigation

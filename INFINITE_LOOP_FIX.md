# Infinite Loop Fix for MyHabitsScreen

## Problem Description

When changing screens in the MyHabitsScreen (e.g., after deleting a habit or completing a habit), the screen would get stuck in an infinite loop. This was related to the swipe feature implementation and state management.

## Root Cause

The issue had two main causes:

### 1. Missing State Synchronization (`didUpdateWidget`)

The `HabitPageView` widget is a `StatefulWidget` that receives a `state` parameter containing the list of habits. When the BLoC emits a new state (e.g., after deleting a habit), the widget is rebuilt with a new state object, but the `_HabitPageViewState` maintained:
- An old `_currentPage` index that could be out of bounds
- A `PageController` that was still pointing to the old page

**Example scenario:**
1. User is viewing habit at index 2 (the 3rd habit out of 3 habits)
2. User deletes this habit
3. BLoC emits new state with only 2 habits
4. `_currentPage` is still 2, but valid indices are now 0-1
5. Accessing `habits[_currentPage]` causes an out-of-bounds error or undefined behavior

### 2. Re-entrant Circular Scroll Jumps

The circular scroll logic (lines 171-192 in the original code) would listen to `ScrollEndNotification` events and call `jumpToPage()`. However, calling `jumpToPage()` itself can trigger scroll events, which can trigger another `ScrollEndNotification`, leading to an infinite loop of jumps.

**Example scenario:**
1. User scrolls to the boundary (last habit, scrolling down)
2. `ScrollEndNotification` is fired
3. Code calls `jumpToPage(0)` to jump to first habit
4. The jump triggers another `ScrollEndNotification`
5. Code detects it's at first page and tries to jump again
6. Infinite loop of jumps

## Solution

### 1. Added `didUpdateWidget` Method

```dart
@override
void didUpdateWidget(HabitPageView oldWidget) {
  super.didUpdateWidget(oldWidget);
  // When habits list changes (e.g., deletion), ensure current page is within bounds
  final habitsLength = widget.state.habits.length;
  if (habitsLength > 0 && _currentPage >= habitsLength) {
    // Jump to the last valid page without triggering animations
    final newPage = habitsLength - 1;
    _currentPage = newPage;
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
      if (mounted && _pageController.hasClients) {
        _pageController.jumpToPage(newPage);
      }
    });
  }
}
```

This ensures that when the widget is rebuilt with a new state:
- `_currentPage` is checked against the new habits list length
- If out of bounds, it's adjusted to the last valid page
- The PageController is synchronized using `jumpToPage` in a post-frame callback

### 2. Added Re-entrancy Guard

Added a `_isJumping` flag to prevent circular scroll logic from being triggered during a jump:

```dart
bool _isJumping = false; // Flag to prevent re-entrant jumps
```

Updated the scroll notification handler:

```dart
if (notification is ScrollEndNotification && !_isJumping) {
  // ... existing logic ...
  
  // When jumping, set flag and reset it after a delay
  _isJumping = true;
  Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 100), () {
    if (mounted) {
      _pageController.jumpToPage(targetPage);
      Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 50), () {
        _isJumping = false;
      });
    }
  });
}
```

### 3. Added Safety Check

Added a guard to only handle circular scrolling when there's more than one habit:

```dart
// Only handle circular scroll if we have more than one habit
if (habits.length <= 1) return false;
```

## Changes Made

**File:** `habit_stacker/lib/presentation/screens/my_habits/my_habits_screen.dart`

**Lines Changed:** ~30 lines added, 1 line modified

1. Added `_isJumping` flag (line 95)
2. Added `didUpdateWidget` method (lines 113-128)
3. Modified circular scroll logic to check `_isJumping` flag (line 189)
4. Added safety check for single habit (line 194)
5. Updated jump logic to set and reset `_isJumping` flag (lines 199-207, 212-220)

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

1. **Test with multiple habits:**
   - Create 3+ habits
   - Swipe through them vertically (circular navigation)
   - Verify no infinite loop occurs at boundaries

2. **Test habit deletion:**
   - View the last habit in the list
   - Delete it
   - Verify the screen updates to show the previous habit
   - Verify no crash or infinite loop

3. **Test habit completion:**
   - Complete a habit via swipe right
   - Verify smooth transition to next habit
   - Verify no infinite loop when reaching the last habit

4. **Test with single habit:**
   - Create only one habit
   - Try vertical swipe (should not trigger circular scroll)
   - Verify stable behavior

### Edge Cases Covered

- ✅ Deleting the currently viewed habit
- ✅ Deleting the last habit while viewing it
- ✅ Circular scroll at boundaries with 2+ habits
- ✅ Single habit (no circular scroll)
- ✅ Rapid state changes from BLoC

## Impact

- **Minimal code changes:** Only modified the state management in `_HabitPageViewState`
- **No breaking changes:** All existing functionality preserved
- **No UI changes:** User interface remains the same
- **Performance:** Added minimal overhead (one boolean flag and boundary checks)
